# Week Six Challenge : PopQuiz

## Description
This challenge illustrates the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop a Quiz application called 'PopQuiz'
This challenge was aimed to help me implement the different syntax used by a frontend web developer to solve day to day problem when it comes to application development.
In the course of this challenge I have learnt how to source questions from an API, create different JS file from scratch and link them, setup timer. The challenges I faced in the course of this challenge is being able to save highscores on local storage and call them when needed which I haven't successfully resolved.

The codes were annotated carefully to allow anyone that accessed it to understand it easily and for continuity.
